	  <h2> The Computers, The future And The Student </h2>
	  <p> My future with information technology is ambiguous for me.<br> I do not really have a clear goal of where I will be taking my computing knowledge and skills to (maybe to a an IT company that has good pay). I think that maybe I will be in a company where I will be developing programs or websites, or maybe I am involved in cybersecurity or networking. The future with IT will probably be decided for me in the next semester or next year. 
	  </p>
	  <h2> Goals </h2>
	  <p> Even though I said my future is not clear, I do have some short-term and long-term goals which is to expand my computing and programming knowledge and properly apply it in real situations. I want to recieve internships so I can understand how it feels to work in the IT environment and the pressure of it. I think that once my knowledge and skills are developed, I may try and start up my own business to fill the niche in the market that is missing. After I try everything, I thought that maybe I could become an IT teacher to teach students and pass down my knowledge.
