	  <h2> Technical Aspects Of The Website </h2>
	  <p> The structure of websites are built using HTML which stands for 'Hyper Text Markup Language'. HTML elements requires basic tags such as HTML, Head, and Body with closing tags, which this website has. Included are divs with classes that separates the elements into meaningful parts that can allow myself to easily identify what part I am styling and what information I am putting into. The structure is a somewhat a "one column layout" as the brown bars on the side as two extra columns. The table below describes the functions of tags or classes and why it was used. 
	  </p>
	  <table>
	  	<tr id="tablehead">
		  <th> HTML Elements (Tags/Class) </th>
		  <th> Function </th>
		  <th> Why was it used? </th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .imagebox </th>
		  <th> A box for the background above the header.</th>
		  <th> Instead of putting an image through 'img' tag, I made it as a background image instead due to the image being large and I wanted it to stretch and fill the whole container.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .header </th>
		  <th> A container for the logo and navigation bar.</th>
		  <th> Purpose is to paddings and borders on the top and bottom so it gives space for the logo and navbar. It also colours the background.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .background </th>
		  <th> Acts as a holder for logo and navbar.</th>
		  <th> The holder sets the width to a specific percentage so the logo and navbar class does not float to both sides of the page respectively.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .logo </th>
		  <th> Space to allow a logo.</th>
		  <th> To make the image fit properly in the header without any issues such as being too large.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .navbar </th>
		  <th> The top navigation bar.</th>
		  <th> Allows styling of font size and colouring, and background too with the removal of underline. It also has its own padding and border to let users know that these can be clicked.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .columnbody </th>
		  <th> The body of all the information (called a column due to being between the bars).</th>
		  <th> This div contains all the columns of left, right and mid. Only purpose is to have a clearfix after.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .left /.right </th>
		  <th> The brown bars that are outside of the contents.</th>
		  <th> The only purpose is to adjust its' width and having background colour.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .mid </th>
		  <th> The middle column.</th>
		  <th> Very important for styling headings, paragraphs, list and tables. Contains the content and image class as well. </th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		 <th> .content </th>
		 <th> The information between column left and right and within column mid.</th>
		 <th> This is the container that actually contains all the information and image. It is used for margins and padding so the words are not aligned all the way to the left.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .image </th>
		  <th> Contains the image within body.</th>
		  <th> Used to position and resize the image, and styled for padding, margins and a border.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .footer </th>
		  <th> The footer of the page</th>
		  <th> Used to adjust the min-height, paddings, background and borders for the top and bottom. Also styles the contents within it.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> .navbarBottom </th>
		  <th> The bottom navigation bar</th>
		  <th> Most of its contents are styed from the class footer, but this includes centering the text and font-size.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th> #copyright </th>
		  <th> The content at the bottom of the page within the footer</th>
		  <th> Its own ID to use for styling the content such as centering the text and also giving it different font weight, variant and style too.</th>
		</tr>

	  <h2> Aesthetics Of The Website </h2>
	  <p>  My approach with the website was to create a website that represents my interest or about me. I first wanted to create something simplistic with soothing colours, but then I changed my mind and chose colours based on one of my favourite artists album, Tom Petty's 'Wildflowers', due to its colour palettes being friendly, comforting and opening. I used the website "colormind.io" to extract the hexadecimal of the colours to get the correct ones that were used. The colour red was only utilised for the header and footer background as these colours are very powerful and to tell the audience that this area is important which is the navigation bar. The light brown was utilised as the background within the body's content because it felt inviting and friendly and the dark brown bars are used to contain all the information within. The colour yellow is only used for the main heading, which pops out to the user to tell what the page is about. The white is used for sub-heading to distinguish what the paragraphs will be about and the black colour on the light brown background felt much better to be read than all white. Overall, the colours are supposed to bring a old-fashion and friendly vibe.
	  </p>
	  <p> The font size are set to a respectable size that prevents the audience from hurting their eye. The size depends on if it is a heading or a paragraph, which allows the audience to understand the difference of importance of information. The footer's navigation bar has smaller font size due to it not being very important and is is another way for the audience to quickly go to another webpage without scrolling all the way to the top. The line-height is set to 1.6 as it is recommended to make it much easier to read the contents and the font type is set to "Trebuchet MS" as I think that this type fits the website. 
	  </p>
	  <p> Another approach of the website was to have two bar columns on both side that when the resolution size would change, it will continue to be there with the contents in between being readable. I have achieved this through utilising a three column bar but it is not so effective as the height of the columns will have to be manually adjusted for each page depending on how much contents there are, for example, this webpage has different column heights compared to others due to how much information there is. I could have done a one column layout but the bars as aesthetics to it making it look better. The information is pushed to the left and right slightly using padding and margins so that none of the texts will touch the bars making it feel more readable. The top navigation bar has borders to distinguish it self from others, even the footer has it. 
	  </p>
	  <h2> Accessibility Aspects Of The Website </h2>
	  <p> The language is set as english to allow any users searching for this website on google to find it easily through english words. Every image has an alternative text which can assist blind users and there is also a title too which when hovered over, it provides some information. The top image is a background which is displayed through CSS. CSS is unable to have an alternative text but I included a title as well as a transparent text on the top left, if for some reason that the image does not appear. Hovering over the navigation bar's button on the header or footer displays where the page is hyperlinked to. The current page button is also underlined to tell the users that they are on this current page.
