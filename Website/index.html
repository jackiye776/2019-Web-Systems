  	  <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>  Hello! My name is Jackie Lim and I am currently studying 'Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Diploma in Information Technology Professional Practice' at University of Sydney Technology (UTS). I am currently in my first year and first semester, and enrolled in the autumn session in 2019. I have not decided on what I will be majoring in yet, but hope I will find something that I want to pursue in the next semester or year. The transition from high school to university was pretty difficult at first as I had to become more independent, but after a few weeks, I am now enjoying university and I am trying my best to take advantage of this course to benefit myself for the future. 
	  </p>
	  <h2> Hobbies / Interest </h2>
	  <p> I somewhat think that I'm not an intersting person, but here are my hobbies that I like to do on a everyday or occasionally: 
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Games (Single-players mainly) </li>
		<li> Drawing </li>
		<li> Music (Favourite genre is 'Rock') </li>
		<li> Reading (non-fiction / fiction)  </li>
		<li> Watching documenteries, movies or TV series </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> I am also intersted in wood working (for some unknown reason) and If I have the time and motivation, I want to try and learn how to play a music instrument especially the guitar or piano.
